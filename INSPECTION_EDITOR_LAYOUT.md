# Useful Calculations

- Anchor points per side
- User counts only need to be calculated for the user height that applies
- The playing area doesn't include steps and if obstacles such as biff bash are present then you need to reduce this area

Judgement can be used here, but must be cautious considering over-loading and evacuation times do factor into this
