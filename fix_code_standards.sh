IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Consult CLAUDE.md before making ANY changes - follow the formatting rules exactly
2. NEVER use backslash continuation for strings - extract variables instead  
3. Extract variables for readability when lines are too long
4. Break down methods over 20 lines by extracting private methods
5. Remove WHAT comments, only keep WHY comments
6. Use modern Ruby syntax (endless methods, numbered parameters, etc.)
7. Run tests after changes to ensure no breakage
8. Apply StandardRB linting when done

Pick 3-5 related violations and fix them systematically. Focus on one area at a time for better maintainability."
