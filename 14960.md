Introduction
Play is the means by which children discover and understand the world in which they live and is an
essential element in a child’s physical and mental growth.
It is important for children’s rounded development that, through play, they arrive at an understanding
of danger, which provides a basis for assessing safety in a variety of situations. The balance between
challenge and safety is an important consideration.
The inflatable play equipment referred to in this standard can provide different levels of challenge and
 -
 - - ` , ,excitement. This European Standard aims to minimize the level of risk and the possibility of serious
 ` , ` , , `injury while allowing children to enjoy themselves when playing in or on inflatable equipment.
 , , ` - ` - `This standard acknowledges the difficulties of addressing safety issues by age criteria alone because
 ` ` , , ` , , ` , , , `the ability to handle risk is based on the individual user’s level of skill and not age. Moreover, users other
 ` ` ` , , , `than the intended age range will make use of the inflatable equipment, in which case, the provisions , , ` , ` , of
this standard still apply.
 ` , ` - -It is not the purpose of the requirements of this standard to affect a child’s need to play nor to lessen the
contribution that inflatable play equipment makes either to the child’s development or meaningful play
from an educational point of view.
Where inflatable play equipment is combined with other items of children’s playground equipment, the
relevant standards applying to the other items of equipment should also be consulted.

1 Scope
This document is applicable to inflatable play equipment intended for use by children fourteen years
and under both individually and collectively.
This document specifies safety requirements for inflatable play equipment for which the primary
activities are bouncing and sliding. It sets measures to address risks and also to minimize accidents to
users for those involved in the design, manufacture and supply of inflatable play equipment. It specifies
information to be supplied with the equipment. The requirements have been laid down bearing in mind
the risk factor based on available data.
This document specifies the requirements that will protect a child from hazards that he or she may
be unable to foresee when using the equipment as intended, or in a manner that can be reasonably
anticipated.
This document is not applicable to inflatable water-borne play and leisure equipment, domestic
inflatable toys, air-supported buildings, inflatables used solely for protection, inflatables used for
rescue, or other types of inflatable toys where the primary activity is not bouncing or sliding.

biphenyls (PCBs).
4.2 Design
4.2.1
 Anchorage
The inflatable shall be provided with an anchorage and/or ballast system and any necessary
accessories enabling the inflatable to be securely fixed to the ground. Each inflatable shall have at least
six anchorage points.
The number of anchorage points shall be calculated in accordance with Annex A. They shall be
distributed around the perimeter of the inflatable (see also 4.2.3) and shall be fitted with metal ends.
The maximum wind- speed in which inflatables shall be used outdoors is 38 km/h (Force 5 on the
Beaufort Scale); see Annex B.
When used outdoors, the inflatable shall be secured to the ground, preferably with ground stakes
where the ground is suitable. Each anchorage point on the inflatable and all of the components of
the anchorage and/or ballast system, e.g. ropes, webbings, metal attachments, stakes, weights, shall
withstand a force of 1 600 N. The direction of the exerted force shall be at an angle to the ground of 30°
to 45°. Ground stakes shall incline away from the direction of the exerted force. Ground stakes shall be
a minimum of 380 mm in length and a minimum of 16 mm in diameter and their tops shall be rounded.
The system shall expose no more than 25 mm of the stake above ground level (see Figure 3).
When the inflatable is used indoors, the anchorage and/or ballast system should be used, when
necessary, to maintain stability.

 under Structural the control integrity
 of an operator.
The minimum air pressure inside the structural parts of the inflatable shall be 1 kPa (100 mm water
gauge). Inflated chambers that are entered by the user are not considered to be structural parts of
the inflatable, e.g. enclosed dome type inflatables. Pressure in the playing area of soft mountains shall
be no greater than 0,25 kPa (25 mm water gauge), but shall maintain a pressure sufficient to prevent
grounding. Pressure in the surrounding safety apron of soft mountains shall be at least 1 kPa (100 mm
water gauge); see Figure 4.
The depth of the trough on the surface of any platform shall be a maximum of 33 % of the width of the
adjacent panel, measured when inflated (see Figure 5).
Containing walls shall be vertical (90 ± 5)°. Towers that support containing walls shall be in the same
plane. Containing walls and towers shall be strong enough to contain the largest and/or heaviest user
for whom the inflatable is designed.
Playing areas, surrounding safety aprons, steps and/or ramps shall support the weight of the largest
and/or heaviest user for whom the inflatable is designed, without grounding. See Annex C for the
test method.

 Access/egress
A step or ramp shall be wide enough to cover the entire access/egress aperture with overlap, according
to Figure 6.
A step or ramp shall have a tread depth of a minimum of 1,5 times the height of the adjacent playing
area platform to which it is attached (see Figure 6).
The playing area of soft mountains shall be completely surrounded by an inflated safety apron. This
safety apron shall have a minimum tread depth of 1,6 m or 0,5 times the height of the playing area
measured from the ground when inflated and in the unloaded condition, whichever is greater.
In the event of air supply failure, the deflation time shall be sufficient to allow users of the inflatable to
be evacuated safely.
NOTE
 Deflation time can be considerably lengthened by inserting a non-return flap in the outlet nozzle of
the blower or at the joint of the connection tube and structure.
Inflatables shall be designed to ensure that adults are able to gain access in order to assist users.
On any open side, the free height of fall shall be no greater than 630 mm from the ground in the unloaded
condition, (600 mm in the loaded condition).
On any open side, the extent of the impact area shall be at least 1,2 m. The surface in the impact area
shall meet the requirements for impact attenuation so that the critical fall height of the surfacing,
according to EN 1177, is at least 630 mm. The impact areas of adjacent inflatables and/or other play
equipment shall not overlap.
Materials such as soil, turf and sand have some impact attenuating properties. Impact absorbing mats
may be used (see Figure 7).

The cylindrical space is shown in Figure 9 and its dimensions are given in Table 1. In determining the
free space, the possible movements of the equipment and the user shall be taken into account.
NOTE 1
 The toggle test (see D.3) is restricted to the free space as practical experience has shown that natural
materials and connections between different parts can vary over time. The definition of free space (see 3.22)
does not include the three-dimensional area in which the falling movement takes place.
Special consideration should be given when using elements of circular cross-section, e.g. round tubes or
poles, to avoid clothing entanglement within the falling space.
Roofs shall be constructed so that they do not trap the toggle when tested in accordance with D.3.
Spindles and rotating parts shall be constructed so as to prevent entanglement of clothing or hair.

 General
Unless stated otherwise, tolerances of the probes in this annex are as follows:
a)
 ± 1 mm for dimensions; and
b) ± 1° for angles.
In situations of doubt when using the probes relating to the tolerance an accurate measurement should
be made to ensure the opening is in accordance with the nominal dimension of the probe.
All tests shall be performed in the most onerous way.

Figure D.1 — Probes for determination of head and neck entrapment in completely

D.2.1.2 Procedure
Apply successively the probes as illustrated in Figure D.1 to each relevant opening. Record and report
the passage of any probe through the opening. If any of the probes are not freely passing through the
opening apply a force of (222 ± 5) N to the probe. When the torso probe is used, it is safer to force the
body through the opening first because if the body passes through then the head will also pass through.
Apply the probe with the axis perpendicular to the plane of the opening.

 The head probe dimensions are based on those for an older child and, therefore, there will be a large

D.2.2.2 Procedure
Position the ‘B’ portion of the test template between and perpendicular to the boundaries of the
opening, as shown in Figure D.3. Record and report whether the template fits within the boundaries of
the opening or if it cannot be inserted to its full thickness.
If the test template can be inserted to a depth greater than the thickness of the template (45 mm), apply
the ‘A’ portion of the test template, so that its centre line is orientated to check the extremities of the
opening as well as the centre line.
Ensure that the plane of the test template is parallel and applied in line with the opening, as shown
in Figure D.4.
Insert the test template along the opening until its motion is arrested by contact with the boundaries of
the opening. Record and report the results including the angle of the template centre line relative to the
vertical and horizontal axes (see Figure D.4) as this will determine the pass/fail requirements given in
4.2.5.2. See Figure D.5 and Figure D.6 for examples of the assessment for the different angular ranges.

 for tear strength
E.1
 Maximum value tongue tear, apparatus
A low inertia, autographic constant rate of traverse cloth tensile testing machine of a suitable range,
power- operated at a rate of (100 ± 10) mm/min. Under the conditions of use, the error of the indicated
or recorded maximum force at any point in the range in which the machine is used does not exceed ± 1 %
of the force. The width of jaws is not less than the width of the specimen.
E.2
 Preparation of test specimens
Five specimens 200 mm × 60 mm shall be cut with the longer dimension in the longitudinal direction of
the roll and five more specimens shall be cut with the longer dimension in the transverse direction of
the roll. The strips shall be evenly spaced from the full usable length and width of the sample and not
within 50 mm of the selvedge.
abcd In each specimen, a lengthways tongue 100 mm × 20 mm shall be cut, as shown in Figure E.1; the line
shall be drawn on each face of the specimen at a distance of 50 mm from the end of the tongue.
In case of coated fabrics of high tear strength, if the tongue breaks or threads are pulled from the fabric
instead of being broken, wider specimens, 200 mm × 150 mm, shall be used with the tongue 50 mm wide.

dry side of the hysteresis curve by pre-conditioning the test pieces in an atmosphere having a relative
humidity of not greater than 10 % and a temperature of between 60 °C and 70 °C.
NOTE
 Air at 65 % humidity and 20 °C will, when heated at constant pressure to between 60 °C and 70 °C,
have a relative humidity of approximately 5 %. Higher temperatures can lead to changes in some coatings.
E.5
 Characteristics of test atmospheres
The use of one of the following atmospheres shall be fixed by the particular standard or specification
for each test or material. The choice of one of these alternatives will depend on the prevalent usage in
individual countries and the variant used shall be reported in the test report.
Atmosphere ‘A’
— temperature (20 ± 2) °C – relative humidity (65 ± 5) %
Atmosphere ‘B’
— temperature (23 ± 2) °C – relative humidity (50 ± 5) %
Atmosphere ‘C’ (tropical)
— temperature (27 ± 2) °C – relative humidity (65 ± 5) %
Atmosphere ‘D’ (temperature control only)
— temperature (23 ± 2) °C
Atmosphere ‘E’ (tropical temperature control only)
— temperature (27 ± 2) °C
E.6
 Methods of conditioning
The test pieces shall be freely exposed to the standard atmosphere ‘A’, ‘B’ or ‘C’ until they are in
equilibrium. Equilibrium with the standard atmosphere is deemed to have been reached when
successive weighing, at intervals of 2 h, of the test pieces freely exposed to the moving air, differ by
less than 0,1 %.
For fabrics coated on one side only, a minimum of 16 h exposure is recommended.
For fabrics coated on both sides, a minimum of 24 h is recommended.
The test pieces shall be freely exposed to the standard atmosphere ‘D’ or ‘E’ for a period of 3 h.
E.7
 Procedure
Carry out the tests in the atmosphere for conditioning and testing described above.
Adjust the testing machine to the rate of clamp movement given in apparatus above and select an
appropriate force capacity range. Disengage any pawls or other arrestments which would prevent two-
way movement of the weighting device. Set the clamps 100 mm apart.
 bcClamp the tongue of the specimen symmetrically in the headstock jaws so that the line is just visible
(see Figure E.2). Similarly, grip the legs of the specimen symmetrically in the traversing jaws so that the
lines ab and cd are just visible and the legs of the specimen are parallel to the force of tear.
Set the traversing jaws in motion. After 60 mm of the fabric has been torn, remove the pen and
disengage the drive.

To determine the median value, count the total number of peaks (n). If n is an odd number, count
downwards, starting at the uppermost peak, a number of peaks equal to (n + 1)/2. The number of the
last n peak counted is the median peak.
 n/2If is an even number, the median value is taken as midway between peaks and (n/2) + 1.

NOTE
 The type of trace illustrated is not suitable for use in determining median values. This type of trace is
usually associated with high inertia instruments and with certain types of non-woven substrates. In such cases,
if the instrument is capable of indicating the average or mean force exerted during the test, the value so indicated
can be reported as the mean tear strength, without reference to the trace. This type of trace can be used where
only maximum values are required.
