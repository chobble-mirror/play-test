# PDF Implementation Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of converting the basic inspection PDF to match the comprehensive layout described in PDF_GENERATION.md.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Break the PDF into logical sections
2. Implement each section incrementally
3. Test after each major section
4. Ensure all data from assessments is included

## Data Mapping

### From Inspection Model
- id â†’ Unique Report Number
- inspection_date â†’ Issue Date
- place_inspected â†’ Place of Inspection
- passed â†’ Pass/Fail Result
- comments â†’ Testimony/Comments
- general_notes â†’ Risk Assessment

### From Unit Model
- name â†’ Description
- manufacturer â†’ Manufacturer
- width, length, height â†’ Size dimensions
- serial_number â†’ Serial Number
- owner â†’ Owner
- has_slide â†’ Unit Type indicator

### From Inspector Company
- name â†’ Issued by Company Name
- rpii_registration_number â†’ RPII Reg Number
- logo â†’ Inspector Logo (if attached)

### From Assessment Models
- All pass/fail fields from each assessment
- All measurement fields
- All comment fields
- Calculated values (required anchors, user capacities, etc.)

## Technical Considerations

### Prawn vs PDFsharp Differences
- Prawn uses different units (72 points per inch)
- Prawn has different font handling
- Prawn has built-in table support
- Need to adjust coordinates from original

### Color Conversions
- Red: #FF0000 or "CC0000"
- Green: #00FF00 or "009900"
- Black: #000000
- SeaShell: #FFF5EE
- LavenderBlush: #FFF0F5

### Font Mapping
| Original | Prawn Equivalent | Size |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| Verdana 14pt Bold | NotoSans 14 :bold | Headers |
| Arial 12pt Bold | NotoSans 12 :bold | Section headers |
| Arial 8pt | NotoSans 8 | Regular text |
| Arial 8pt Bold | NotoSans 8 :bold | Labels |
| Arial 6pt | NotoSans 6 | Small text |
